Candy Crisis 
In this project you will implement a heuristic sear
ch to play a puzzle called Candy Crisis.  Candy Cri
sis is a type of 
sliding puzzle played with 14 tokens representing d
ifferent types of candies in a box.  The box has 15
 predetermined 
positions arranged in a box of 3 rows and 5 columns
.   
Initially, the player is given a random arrangement
 of candies in it, and the goal of the game is to r
earrange the candies 
into a symmetrical arrangement by sliding them one 
at a time into the empty space.  Only a candy direc
tly next to the 
empty space, not including diagonally, can be moved
 into it. 
A symmetrical arrangement (a goal state) is one whi
ch is balanced around the middle row, and there are
 no constraints 
on the middle row.  In other words, if the top row 
is identical to the bottom row, then the puzzle is 
solved.
